# Quadtree Module
TIER: scratch/ implementation
COMPLETION: partial
- Extract a quadrant/rectangle geometry module
- Take advantage of import qualified in lieu of names like 'quadTreeHeight'
- Quadtree functions that still need implementation:
  - insert
  - split node
  - lookup tree by quadrant
    - (and or quadrant sequence?)
  - lookup partition by arbitrary point on grid
    - (return type is quadrant sequence?)
  - print as tree (currently untested and unpolished)
  - print as diagram

# User Interface Module
TIER: not implemented
COMPLETION: none
- Load a prebuilt scene
- Accept a test point & print report

# Test Module(s)
TIER: not implemented
COMPLETION: none
- confirm each module is working as expected
